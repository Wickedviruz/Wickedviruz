## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hello there!

I'm a passionate developer from Sweden who loves building things that make life easier. My main interests lie in **process automation**, **systems programming**, and crafting well-structured software from scratch.

## 💻 Tech I Work With

- 🦀 **Rust** – My go-to language for performance and systems programming.
- ⚙️ **Automation & Scripting** – I enjoy automating workflows and repetitive tasks.
- 🌐 **Fullstack Development** – From backend APIs to modern frontend interfaces.
- 🧪 **Experimentation** – Always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas.

## 🔧 Current Projects

- 🚀 **FlintAPI** – A lightweight, Rust-based web framework inspired by FastAPI and Flask.
- 💬 **RustCord** – A Discord-style desktop chat app built with Tauri, React, and Rust.

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Deepen my knowledge in **low-level systems** and **Rust**.
- Build a **long-term, real-world software project** from scratch – not just toy examples.
- Sharpen my skills in **software architecture and design**.
