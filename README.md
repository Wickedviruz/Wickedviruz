# 👋 Hey there!

I'm a curious coder from Sweden who enjoys building real stuff — not just toy projects. I like solving problems with code, especially when it involves automation, systems programming, or just making life a bit easier.

## ⚙️ What I’m into

- 🦀 Rust – My favorite tool for building fast and reliable systems
- 🖥️ Automation – I love automating workflows and annoying tasks
- 🌍 Fullstack – Backend, frontend, whatever gets the job done
- 🧪 Learning by building – I learn best by creating real-world projects

## 🚧 What I’m working on

- **FlintAPI** – A lightweight web framework in Rust (FastAPI vibes)
- **RustCord** – A desktop chat app like Discord, built with Tauri + Rust + React
- **TFS Port** – Rewriting The Forgotten Server from C++ to Rust (yes, seriously!)

## 🎯 Goals

- Get really good at Rust and systems design
- Build projects I’d actually use
- Keep learning and have fun doing it

## 📫 Let's connect

If you’re into Rust, automation, or want to chat about nerdy stuff – feel free to reach out!
